making bad choices
 - postgresql tables instead of sequences
 - start at -2147483647 instead of 0 or 1

 - love of intricacy; equals the love of craft
 
 

Motivations for a particular coding style; for coding a small block
of code in a certain way:

cute
gadfly/tormentor - put a stick in your eye for the sake of it
cosmetic
dogmatic 
rebel - "it's not odd enough"
to prove myself different/distinguish myself
desire for control
allegiance to a vendor or other entity
the "tie-in" (to another product?  same as above)
learned a cool technique (in college, on an algorithm web site, from a workshop)
