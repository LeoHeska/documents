    <div align="left">There are a lot of ways we may store and transmit
      anonymized ProdBase extracts. Some require only brief mention:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>XML. Very readable but kind of passe, and bloated. The bang
          for us is small and the buck (processing overhead, bloat) too
          high.</li>
        <li>JSON. Favored nowadays; created as a way to reduce XML's
          bloat. It does, but only by about 50%. Still too bloated for
          our use.<br>
        </li>
        <li>EDI and other proprietary, obscure, and or "technical"
          formats. Too much work and complexity; too-low bang for
          too-high buck.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Possible/candidate storage and transmission format we may use
        for anonymized ProdBase extracts:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Key-value pairs</li>
        <li>Delimited flat files without header records</li>
        <li>Delimited flat files with header records</li>
        <li>Positionally formatted flat files, no header records</li>
        <li>Hybrid; positionally formatted followed by key-value</li>
        <li>Encoded single values</li>
      </ul>
      Advantages, disadvantages, and storage considerations of each of
      these, I present below for discussion and consideration.<br>
      <h3>Key-value pairs<br>
      </h3>
      <p>Currently one of the (leading) options for formatting an
        anonymized ProdBase extract looks like this (lines truncated
        here for display):<br>

          </tt></p>

      Advantages:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>No header record needed as long as all parties recognize
          that the left column is an AshID. For humans that's easy - the
          AshID is the left column, it looks different fromn all the
          rest, it's the only column that doesn't contain a dash. These
          are probably distinction enough to "set it off" - humans can
          read this.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Key-value pairs make the format self-documenting.</li>
        <li>Key-value pairs mean that new keys may be added at any time</li>
        <ul>
          <li>No recoding of export or import processes needed</li>
          <li>Downstream processes, though, may need recoding and/or
            reconfiguration, to make use of the new data.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Disadvantages:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>This hybrid format will never be maximally nice to ingest
          with automated tools. It's almost key-value pairs throughout,
          but not quite; the first field has no key. Therefore a
          "programming trick" will be needed prior to ingestion, if
          automated parsing tools that expect key-value pairs are to be
          used. Such "tricks" may or may not be available in all input
          processing routines, packages, and/or languages. This extra
          complexity can cause extra development effort, require more
          moving parts, and/or slow processing in production.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Possibility of duplication</li>
        <ul>
          <li>There is nothing within the file structure itself that
            prevents something like this:</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      Bloat:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>At a glance at sample data, about 65% bloat:<br>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Other than the AshID, every field consists of 1 to 3
            characters of information, but 6 additional characters are
            required for the encoding. Like so:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Field: <tt>|1270-11</tt></li>
            <li>Information content: <tt>11</tt></li>
            <li>Formatting and metadata: <tt>|1270-</tt></li>
            <li>Average content, 2 characters. Average formatting and
              metadata, 6 characters. This yields the 300% bloat.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Upon analysis of sample data, 81% bloat:</li>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <li>72,651 bytes of values (50,760 total values)<br>
            </li>
            <li>381,091 bytes total of all value strings</li>
            <li>This yields the 81% bloat<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      Advantages:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>No "programming trick" needed to ingest. All fields are just
          fields. Very many input routines, tools, and packages can
          handle this format as is.</li>
        <li>If the ingestor is configurable:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>No recoding of export or import processes needed</li>
          <li>Downstream processes, though, may need recoding and/or

        </ul>
        <li>No possibility of duplication as is possible with key/value
          pairs; this format does not permit transmitting values that
          conflict.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Disadvantages:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>This format is not self-documenting. To ingest the data, a
          separate metadata store must be communicated to the ingesting
          program, either at design/coding or configuration time. The
          possibility does exist that the data layout may change, but
          the metadata will not, creating an out-of-synchronization
          condition. <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Bloat:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>5% improvement over key/value pairs.</li>
        <li>Sample data show that average line length of records stored
          in this format is 404 characters, versus 421 characters
          formatted as key/value pairs.</li>
        <li>The 210 delimiters per line are "waste" from an information
          content point of view. However, this is more than offset by
          eliminating the verbose keys.</li>
        <li>Internal bloat shows 48% data, 52% delimiters.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>

        <li>Effectively the same as flat-file records without headers;
          all we do is add one header record; a tiny relative addition
          in the case of large files.</li>

      <h3>Positionally formatted flat files, no header records<br>

      Note how nicely the fields all line up. Examining the total sample
      input data file, they don't all line up as perfectly as that, but
      the sameness of format and occurrence of values is apparent. In
      such a situation, the following data formatting option may be

      Advantages:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>This is, or at least may be, the most efficient of all our

      <ul>
        <li>This looks old-fashioned! Though seemingly silly, we must
          not discount this factor. This scheme predates both computers
          and electronics, going all the way back to the Hollerith card
          and the 1890 (no that is not a typo) U.S. census. No one will
          ever look at a presentation of this scheme and react "cool!"
          Even if it happens to be the best option, all things
          considered.<br>

        <li>As with other headerless formats, the possibility does and

      Again, we may advantageously remove delimiters, going to a
      positional scheme. But note toward the end of the top line, the
      value 1941, not present in other records. If there are enough
      instances of this sort of thing (variant attribute availability)
      then a hybrid scheme might be optimal. First, on the left side
      (before the vertical bar character), come all the positionally
      formatted data. Then come the key-value pairs. Like so:<br>

        then this would be the most efficient of all our options. We use
        the best of both worlds; skipping the overhead of both
        delimiters and of keys when that is beneficial, but then, using
        keys when (and only when) it is beneficial to do so.<br>

      There is another scheme, that is already used at Anonom and could
      be used in this instance. That is:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>encode all this information as single values</li>
        <li>each single value contains both a definitional and a data
          element.</li>
      </ul>
      So, working from the above example:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><tt>aaaaa means 1270-11</tt></li>
        <li><tt>aaaab means </tt><tt>1270-20</tt></li>
        <li><tt>aaaac means </tt><tt>1270-36</tt></li>
        <li><tt>aaaad means </tt><tt>1271-08X</tt></li>
        <li><tt>aaaae means </tt><tt>1271-20S</tt></li>
        <li>and so on<tt>.<br>
          </tt></li>
      </ul>
      Obviously this is just a "toy" example and the real scheme would
      use different mappings. But as long as the ProdBase information to
      be stored and transmitted consists of a smallish set of enumerable
      values (which would exclude storing information such as decimal
      values), this scheme is possible.<br>
      <br>
      Advantages:
      <ul>
        <li>Variable-length records nicely supported.</li>
        <li>Order of data within a record is not important.<br>
        </li>
        <li>New encodings may be added at any time</li>
        <ul>
          <li>No recoding of export or import processes needed</li>
          <li>Downstream processes, though, may need recoding and/or
            reconfiguration, to make use of the new data.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Disadvantages:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>This scheme does still inhere the risk of
          non-synchronization of metatdata and data. If the definitional
          scheme ever changes, but that is not communicated to the
          ingesting system, incorrect processing and interpretation will
          result.</li>
        <li>Possibility of duplication</li>
        <ul>
          <li>There is nothing within the file structure itself that
            prevents something like this (given the sample scheme shown
            above, this is an internal contradiction):</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      Bloat:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>This sort of scheme will almost certainly not be efficient
          as regards data storage, compared to some others described
          here. In the example shown here, using&nbsp; 5 alphanumeric
          characters (which seems a plausible length), it therefore
          takes 5 characters to express what is expressed in just one
          character in some of the other schemes. Which works out to 80%
          bloat. A better analysis, using sample data, I have not
          carried out.<br>
