      </center><h3><b>Big data - low impact density</b></h3><h3>      </h3>      The dirty little secret about big data: it's about 99.999% junk.
      <br>
      <br>A log entry details how somebody surfed to a dog site. Or, we find from a Twitter data feed that the puppy peed on the carpet. Good info? Maybe. You might figure that an information broker can relay "pet owner" or "dog interest" to a vet, pet supplier, carpet cleaning company, or ad broker. But if this is the 113th puppy tweet, or the 1,267th site visit (both quite possible), the incremental value of the tweet or the log record is very near zero. Now add in the very many valueless records, plus the irrelevant data in each record; you come up with high percentages of junk.
      <br>
      <br>Excited by new technologies like Hadoop, working at new levels of scale (petabytes, exabytes), it's easy to lose sight of this. The tech is cool, but most of the content is garbage, irrelevant, uninteresting, valueless, uninformative, misleading, repetitive, redundant, fragmentary, and/or incomplete.
      <br>
      <br>This is the way of big data. At Fermilab we processed petabytes of data about subatomic particle collisions. Well over 99.999% of these were of zero interest. Google crawls &amp; trawls millions (or billions) of virtually-identical credit card application pages. The NSA stores oceans of personal communication, very important to the parties concerned, but irrelevant to the detection of evildoers.
      <br>
      <br>A metric I call Impact Density attempts to classify data utility (interest, meaning) per number of bytes:
      <br>       <h3><b>Impact Density</b>      </h3>
      <table border="1">

      </table>Note that non-big-data technologies, such as human memory, written notes, spreadsheets, and Oracle, are more suited to richer data (data with higher impact ratios). Only outside their limits do good cases for big data technologies such as Hadoop emerge.
      <br>       <h3><b>Concentrating, filtering, and finding. Limits of usefulness, better ways.</b>      </h3>      Big data's dilution and contamination can be offset by tools like Hadoop, which may "find the flowers in the weeds." But other methods or tools might do the same job faster and cheaper. For example:
      <br>
      <br>Data broker to potential client:
      <br>
      <br>"Have we got a lead for you! A pet owner, medium-high income, in your area, that may need veterinary services. Our expert data scientists found you this lead by processing mountains of data with massive state-of-the-art computing clusters. We will sell you this lead for $12.00."
      <br>
      <br>Would-be client to data broker:
      <br>
      <br>"No thanks - I already got that lead (and more) from the 4-H group I sponsor."
      <br>
      <br>When working with big data, it's good to keep in mind that people are always seeking better ways of finding things out. They're likely to succeed - other data can tell us the same things that big data can.
      <br>       <h3><b>Summarizing, aggregating, counting, and profiling</b>      </h3>      Another way big data tools can reduce massive data sets to information on the scale humans can process, is to characterize the data in some way. This generally amounts to counting plus arithmetic. We may, by examining billions of records, be able to determine that Ad A's lift was 120% lift, versus Ad B's 160%. Or that a particular ad resonates better with certain age groups. These are decades-old concepts, standard advertising analyses; the same averages, percentages, comparisons, etc. We're just using massive data sets.
      <br>       <h3><b>Not "me, too!"</b>      </h3>      Other companies already filter and characterize big data. We're building capacity to analyze DFA<sup>
         <a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>data in richer, more client-customizable and innovative ways than Google supports. This may earn revenue, but Google, noticing our superior analytics, could simply improve their own. So, this is only a first step.
      <br>
      <br>We can combine content from multiple sources (twitter feeds, DFA, Omniture), but again, so can others.
      <br>
      <br>Other ways to add value include filtering, aggregating, and combining data. These are useful, possibly profitable, and sometimes necessary for further steps. But what should these further steps be?
      <br>       <h3><b>Proprietary data, and expertise</b>      </h3>      What can we do, that others cannot? The first obvious answer, is to tie together external data with proprietary data; data that only we have. An easy and obvious strategy, "focus on our competitive advantage," and it can work.
      <br>
      <br>Note however that our data describe a reality that is also known to others. We might figure, for example, that our proprietary list of subscribers to a magazine, represent a data set that cannot be matched. This is trivially true if by "matched" we mean "matched in content," but not if we mean "matched in usefulness." Especially for advertising purposes, there are other ways of accomplishing "about the same result," ways that are available to others.
      <br>
      <br>Ideally we may combine information known only to us with external, publicly available (and/or available for sale) information. For example:
      <br>
      <ul>
         <li>Find out who viewed realtors' "relocation" pages (these data we buy), and, are of a certain income level with a senior in the household (these data we own).
         </li>
         <li>Identify persons who live in the greater Cleveland area who access music websites.
         </li>
         <li>Identify persons who live near a Target store with a first child nearing school age, that have accessed websites of Target competitors.
         </li>
      </ul>                    And here are some ways we could possibly improve/augment current data products:
      <br>
      <ul>
         <li>Identify habits, interests, outlooks, etc.; augment our "demographics" with "psychometrics."
         </li>
         <li>Identify connections between households and persons (greatly affects amenability).
         </li>
         <li>Improve/refine our data regarding gender, ethnicity, languages spoken, et cetera.
         </li>
      </ul>These are not suggestions for projects; some of these may work, others may not. These are just sample ideas that point to a strategy for using big data.
      <br>       <h3><b>Little tips about big data</b>      </h3>      <b>Remember the nature of the data:</b>Tweets, DFA data, and much of the rest are anecdotes: "Somebody said this." "Somebody went there and did that." Let's remember that "the plural of anecdote is not data"
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
      </span><sup>
         <a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> These datasets can amount to mountains of junk, from which data with business impact are very difficult to glean.
      <br>
      <br>      <b>Appropriate:</b> Big data tools may be valuable, but only when put to best/most appropriate use.
      <br>
      <br>      <b>Alternatives:</b>Other technologies and methods can and do beat big data, sometimes. Devoting big resources to processing very low-impact-density data is something we would prefer not to do. If, for example, there's a better way to identify all higher-income soon-to-be brides in an area, let's use it. If we don't, our customers will, leaving us with a data product nobody wants.
      <br>
      <br>      <b>Obsolescence: </b>When calculating payback we should not presume longevity of our information product. Besides the fact that people might find non-big-data ways to gain the same insights, the big data streams themselves may go obsolete. Tweets are a big deal right now, but in 5 or so years they may be "old hat."
      <br>
      <br>      <b>Support:</b> A bug report I submitted about Pig (a bid data programming language) has sat for months without apparent attention. Pig, like most big data tools are open source. Without the workaround I coded myself, our situation could be pretty bad. We get some support from Cloudera but not the kind normally considered essential to enterprise systems. Lack of support, in a sense, is a vital threat.
      <br>
      <br>      <b>Scale and performance:</b>With big data we hit performance limits. Suppose we want to share a cluster between clients. Moving client data from disk to tape, could take so long that it would sink the effort.
      <br>
      <br>      <b>New ground, sparsely populated:</b> Hadoop's website<sup>
         <a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>lists/claims about 160 users. Even if the true number is ten times as large, that's still a small number. The user community is small and support very limited. Treading new ground, absent much company, we are likely to encounter situations no one else has. We must be careful, expect delays, and include this in our plans and promises.
      <br>
      <br>      <b>Focusing on the sweet spot, profitability</b>
      <br>
      <br>Big data tools, like others, have advantages, disadvantages, and costs. To work, and to pay for themselves, they must be put to best use. Some such uses, currently planned and/or under construction:
      <br>
      <ul>
         <li>Ingesting large data sets such as DFA and Omniture.
         </li>
         <li>Analyzing these data sets both for business value, and also for internal metrics, such as coverage.
         </li>
         <li>Correlating large data sets while maintaining privacy.
         </li>
         <li>Using those correlations to build information products, for sale or rent.
         </li>
         <li>Extending coverage. Ingesting more and different data sets to create a map of the landscape:
         </li>
         <ul>
            <li>in the greatest detail
            </li>
            <li>with the most complete coverage
            </li>
            <li>with the least junk
            </li>
            <li>with the smallest number of false leads, incorrect identification, and overlap
            </li>
            <li>at the smallest cost in infrastructure, labor, and in purchasing data sets
            </li>
         </ul>
      </ul>Specifically, the AAA and DMP initiatives together aim to ingest online/external data, analyze these data, correlate them with existing data we own, improve/augment these data thereby, and provide a premium product for sale to clients.
